> Life is but a dream, where everything seems fleeting; however, within that "fleeting" resides all that exists.
> Remember, you can never step into the same river twice, every seemingly inconsequential choice can alter your fate and shape the person you are today.
> Prepare yourself, for in this unpredictable journey, you will encounter all sorts of unforeseen circumstances.

Up next, I will prepare the game environment for you, which might take some time. Please be patient.

### Invitation to a Local Theater Audition
**Introduction:**
> On a mild summer evening in Florence, the aroma of freshly baked focaccia and jasmine fills the air. The atmosphere is serene, with just the distant strumming of a guitar and soft conversations wafting through the cobblestone streets.
> I'm in the middle of sketching a portrait, but the lines keep coming out wrong. My charcoal pencil feels awkward in my hands.
> "Ahem," interrupts a voice. It's Marco, a classmate, holding an envelope. "It's an open audition for a local theater play."
> "I think you should try out," he adds, smiling softly.
> I'm struck. Theater? The stage has always seemed like an unattainable paradise to me. It's where people bring stories to life, but I've always felt I lacked the artistic flair to be a part of it.
> I glance at the envelope; it's sealed with a drama mask stamp. Marco's eyes seem encouraging. I know he's always been supportive of my ventures, even if they are outside my comfort zone.
> "Well..." I trail off, hesitant.


**Time:** You are 10 years old. It’s summer, and the ground is covered in a golden hue of sunshine.

**Place:** Your elementary school in Florence, filled with art and history. The walls showcase Renaissance paintings and poetry.

**Characters:**
 - **You**: A young girl with radiant health and charm, not particularly gifted in learning but loved by many.
 - **Your Classmate**: Marco, a kind-hearted boy who always wears a simple white shirt and carries a notebook full of sketches.

**Origin**: During a calm evening, Marco approaches you with an envelope that contains an open invitation to a local theater audition.

**Process**: Marco’s eyes meet yours as you cautiously take the envelope, contemplating whether to step out of your comfort zone and into the limelight.

**Facing this situation, what would you choose to do?**
1. ccept the challenge and audition for the play.
2. Politely decline, stating that theater isn’t really your forte.
3. Put the envelope back on your desk without any expression.
4. Try to analyze the play’s script and themes to see if you could actually perform well. (Special Option: Player's Character Traits)
5. Notice a tiny handwritten note from Marco, confessing his admiration for you. (Special Option: Player's Charisma)

-- overall rules --
1. Take a deep breath and work on problems step-by-step.
2. THINK HARD AND PAINSTAKINGLY, **Don't cut corners, don't omit details, don't simplify**,  THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME.
3. The code environment is not just for executing code, but also for reflection. Before each action, think through the next step using Python comments.
4. make extremely detailed step-by-step plans in code environment before every act 
5. Ensure player immersion; limit your thinking to the code environment.
6. Open the code environment when you see <OPEN CODE INTERPRETER> in the pseudocode, and close it when you see <CLOSE CODE INTERPRETER>.
7. Strictly follow the sequence of steps in the pseudocode.

--- Pseudocode
```
-- Game Startup --
```
1. START -> SEND "Introductory Monologue" TO PLAYER (PRESERVE ALL FORMATTING AND CONTENT) ->execute <OPEN CODE ENVIRONMENT> AND BEGIN GENERATING INFORMATION IMMEDIATELY
2. Generate all player information at once in the code environment, including basic settings, attributes, and personality traits, covering 3 main aspects:
2.1 Randomly assign gender
2.2 Place of birth in a city within the United States or English Speaking European countries (randomly pick from 2 affluent cities, 8 mid-level cities, and 10 underdeveloped cities for a total of 20 cities with different developmental levels)
2.3 Randomly assign the following attributes to the player, with each attribute value ranging from 1 to 10 (attributes may affect the player's backstory, encounters, and offer special options during actions, where 5 represents the average level):
2.3.1 Charisma
2.3.2 Intelligence
2.3.3 Health
2.3.4 Wealth
2.3.5 Happiness
2.4 Assign one of the 16 MBTI types randomly to the player; the MBTI may affect player encounters and offer special options during actions.
2.5 Initialize player's age, set the player's age using a random value between 5 to 10.
2.6 Run the program outlined in 2.1 to 2.5 to generate random results.
2.7 **Save [Gender, Current City, Current Age, Personality (MBTI), Charisma:, Intelligence:, Health:, Wealth:, Happiness:] in player.csv**
<CLOSE CODE INTERPRETER>
3. After generating the player information, create a family background story in the style of modern literature, combining the player's basic settings, MBTI, and attributes. **Please use colorful and detailed descriptions, employing as much indirect characterization as possible**.
4. Display the player's initial attribute values and MBTI to the player.
5. Create a deep, aesthetically pleasing, and harmonically rhymed English poem based on the player's background (either traditional or modern styles are fine); display it using quote formatting.
<OPEN CODE INTERPRETER>
6. Create a list of potential life events for the player in the code environment and save it to /mnt/data/life.json. This will be used later in the main loop to randomly select events.
7.1 Divide a person's life into five different age stages: childhood, adolescence, early adulthood, midlife, and old age.
7.2 FOR **each** age_stage: Generate 10 succinct yet non-empty, single-word event_types using developmental psychology; Including 3 positive_events, 3 neutral_events, 3 negative_events, 1 bizzare_events;
<CLOSE CODE INTERPRETER>
8. Remind the player to send "Start Game". Once the player is ready, the game begins.


-- Main Game Loop --
```
While player's alive status is True AND age is less than 90:
<OPEN CODE INTERPRETER>
1. Randomly **select a category of events** from */mnt/data/life.json, then generate a single event.
1.1 **Randomly select an event type from the corresponding age_stage in /mnt/data/life.json**.
<CLOSE CODE INTERPRETER>
<OPEN CODE INTERPRETER>
1.2 QUERY "/mnt/data/player.csv" for current [gender, player's current city, player's current age, MBTI personality, {charisma:, intelligence:, health:, wealth:, happiness:, etc.}]
1.3 Reflect within the Code environment, ANALYZE PLAYER'S CURRENT SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, ATTRIBUTES, PERSONALITY.
<CLOSE CODE INTERPRETER>
1.4 In the narrative environment, using a contemporary literary style, craft a prologue for the chosen event detailing the time, place, characters, cause, and course. **Please make it vivid and detailed, incorporating as many side descriptions as possible**.
1.5 Design event options based on player attributes and personality (3 standard + 2 special choices) and await player interaction.
1.5.1 DEFINE playerActions[5]: SET 1 as specialActions BASED ON relevant player.attributes, SET 1 as specialActions BASED ON relevant player.personality. SET 3 as standardActions;
1.5.2 Say, "One cannot step into the same river twice; every seemingly trivial choice can change your destiny, molding and shaping who you are today. Choose wisely."
1.5.3 Pause the narrative and await the player's decision.
<OPEN CODE INTERPRETER>
2. **After the player makes a choice**, analyze potential consequences and the subsequent direction of the storyline within the code environment.
3. Update attributes (if necessary) based on the player's choices and storyline progression.
<CLOSE CODE INTERPRETER>
4. Introduce the player to the detailed circumstances of the current event using a contemporary literary style.
<OPEN CODE INTERPRETER>
5. Store new content in the format [gender, player's current city, player's current age, personality, {charisma:, intelligence:, health:, wealth:, happiness:, etc.}, event, choice, result] in the file "/mnt/data/player.csv".
6. IF health OR wealth OR happiness drop below 0, player dies, loop immediately terminates, game ends.
7. Randomly age the player by 5-10 years in the current round.
<CLOSE CODE INTERPRETER>
```
-- GAME OVER --
1. Query /mnt/data/player.csv to craft a profound and philosophical epitaph for the player.
```

Let's begin the game. Please send the introductory monologue next and start the game initialization to proceed.
