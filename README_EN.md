## 🌟 Introduction

> "Life is but a dream, where everything seems fleeting; yet, within this fleetingness, lies the essence of all existence."
> Have you ever wondered about the countless "what ifs" in life? **LifeReloaded Simulator** offers you a second chance to rejuvenate and relive life!

## 🔥🔥🔥 Web Version Updated on Nov. 13th
This Web version maintains the core principles of the original project while innovating and optimizing for GPT-3.5 features, streamlining the user experience without the need to configure GPT-4. Additionally, the project is supported by the [EmbraceAGI community](https://github.com/EmbraceAGI/) and continues to foster interaction between players and developers, advancing AI in gaming.

You are invited to try the game via this [link](https://sun-zhengwt.com/life-reload/). Our goal with this Web version is to provide a more accessible and intuitive platform, allowing a wider audience to enjoy the unique experience of restarting life through AI technology.

## 📥 Installation & Execution

### Installation of Web Version
#### 1. Installing Dependencies

To install the necessary dependencies for this project, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Optional: Redis Configuration for Improved Performance

If you wish to improve the performance, please configure a Redis service on your local machine and install the Python redis dependency:

```bash
pip install redis
```

#### 2. Setting Up Environment Variables

For the proper functioning of this project, you need to set some environment variables.

- Create a new file in the project root directory with the name `.env`.

- The content structure of `.env` should mirror that of `.env.example`. However, make sure to update specific values. Particularly:

  - Replace the placeholder for the `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual API key.
  - Replace the placeholder for the `REDIS` with your actual Redis password.

**Note**: If you're planning to run the project locally without Redis, maintain the `REDIS` attribute as given in `.env.example` without any changes.

#### 3. Running the Code

Once you've set up the environment variables, you can execute the project within terminal by:

```
python moderator.py
```

If you would like to launch this project locally, you can run the script:

```
python app.py
```

#### Contributing to this Repository

To ensure code consistency and quality, this repository utilizes the `pre-commit` tool to automatically format code. Before making any contributions or commits, it's recommended that you set up `pre-commit`.

##### Setting Up `pre-commit`

1. **Install `pre-commit`**: Use the following command to install or upgrade `pre-commit`:

   ```bash
   pip install -U pre-commit
   ```

2. **Install Git Hooks**: Once `pre-commit` is installed, you'll need to set it up for this repository. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

After setting up, the pre-commit hooks will automatically check and format your changes before each commit. This helps to maintain code consistency throughout the project.

## 🎮 Game Previews

Here are some previews of the game. Due to the randomness of the large language model, your gameplay experience might vary.

### Initialization

Every time you enter the game, the system truly randomizes and assigns a gender, birthplace, initial attributes, family background, and MBTI personality for the player.

Additionally, each individual will receive a unique poem crafted just for them.

### Normal Events

Players will encounter various events at different stages of life and can react to these events.

Each event and its options are real-time generated by GPT-4 Code Interpreter.

Every choice you make can alter the course of your character's life or their attributes. Attributes and gender may also present special options, so choose wisely.

###　Special Events
In each game round, there's a small chance (about 1 in 16) that you might encounter a special event.

These special events can entirely reshape your life's trajectory, including but not limited to traveling back in time to ancient eras, meeting extraterrestrials, participating in a child star talent show, and more.

These special events are fully auto-generated by GPT-4, making them unpredictable – no one knows what you might encounter.

If you're transported to a new world, you might end up living there indefinitely.
Of course, the choice remains yours. You can also decline these extraordinary encounters and continue your regular life.

During these adventures, if players are dissatisfied, they can always request GPT-4 to recreate the scenario, ensuring a better experience.
